# Training Safer AI: Harnessing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback on AMD GPUs for Large Language Models

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. By integrating reinforcement learning from human input, RLHF enables the development of more reliable, ethical, and contextually appropriate AI systems.

Traditional language model training methods, while effective at generating coherent text, often fall short when it comes to understanding nuanced human values and contextual appropriateness. RLHF addresses these limitations by incorporating human feedback directly into the training loop, teaching models to recognize and generate outputs that humans consider "good" or "desirable."

The RLHF process typically involves three key phases:

1. **Pre-training a base language model**
2. **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** using human-provided examples
3. **Reinforcement learning** based on a reward model trained on human preferences

By iteratively refining the model based on this feedback, RLHF enables safer and better-aligned language models, which is especially critical in mitigating the risks of harmful or biased outputs generated by AI systems.

Here are three popular algorithms used to implement RLHF:

1. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: PPO is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies using a clipping mechanism to stabilize updates and prevent drastic changes. It strikes a balance between sample efficiency and stability, making it suitable for large-scale model training. However, PPO can experience slower convergence and a trade-off between bias and variance, potentially hindering performance. It requires substantial GPU memory to load multiple models—policy, reference policy, reward, and value models—resulting in resource-intensive training. A policy model in reinforcement learning is a model that maps states to actions, determining how an agent should behave in different situations to maximize cumulative rewards. A reward model predicts the immediate reward an agent receives after taking an action in a particular state, reflecting short-term feedback. A value model estimates the long-term cumulative reward of being in a specific state or taking a specific action, guiding the agent to maximize future rewards. Additionally, PPO's complexity can lead to implementation challenges and out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially with larger batch sizes or model scales. Despite these drawbacks, PPO remains widely adopted for its effectiveness in policy optimization.

2. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: DPO directly optimizes a model based on human preferences without a reward model. It simplifies training by learning from pairwise comparisons of outputs, aligning closely with human values. However, DPO's reliance on high-quality human feedback can be a limitation, as extensive human annotation is often required, which can be challenging to scale.

3. **Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO)**: RLOO is an efficient alternative to PPO that reduces memory usage and accelerates training. Unlike PPO, RLOO treats the entire completion of the prompt as a single action, which eliminates the need for a value model and simplifies reward calculations. This leads to significant memory savings (50-70% less vRAM) and faster training speeds (2-3x faster than PPO). RLOO's approach enhances scalability, allowing for larger batch sizes while maintaining competitive performance with PPO, making it a more accessible option for large-scale RLHF training. If you're interested in learning more about RLOO, check out this excellent blog on Hugging Face: [Putting RL Back in RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/putting_rl_back_in_rlhf_with_rloo).

In this blog, we will demonstrate how to implement RLHF using the RLOO algorithm on the [`tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct`](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) model on AMD GPUs, improving its safety with the [`hh-rlhf`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) dataset (please follow the link if you want to explore the dataset) from Anthropic. Since `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` has already been instruction fine-tuned, we will first train a reward model using `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` and then perform the reinforcement learning phase on `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` using the reward model. We opt for a smaller reward model to optimize computational resources.

## Implementation

We will use this [ROCm PyTorch Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocm/pytorch/rocm6.2_ubuntu22.04_py3.10_pytorch_release_2.3.0/images/sha256-931d3e3dcebe6c6fab84adf16cfca3e1d1449100df7c881a46fccd06f6c9bc1c?context=explore) for this demonstration on AMD GPUs. The container will be run on a server equipped with MI300x AMD GPUs and Ubuntu. For smooth reproduction, we recommend using the same versions of ROCm, PyTorch, and Python specified in the `docker run` command below.

For a full list of hardware and operating systems supported by AMD, refer to [System Requirements (Linux)](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).

Run the following command to pull and launch the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --network=host --privileged --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
--group-add video --shm-size=13G \
--name=<name_of_your_docker_container> rocm/pytorch:rocm6.2_ubuntu22.04_py3.10_pytorch_release_2.3.0 /bin/bash
```

To implement the RLOO algorithm, we will utilize the `trl` (transformer reinforcement learning) library developed by Hugging Face, which provides reinforcement learning algorithms tailored for transformer-based LLMs. We use Weights and Biases (`wandb`) to track training progress. If you prefer not to use `wandb`, you can modify the `report_to` argument in the scripts. Once inside the running Docker container, install the necessary packages with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git
cd trl
git checkout de3876577c1cc37e5c16d0982ecb417c4bd6a752
pip install .
pip install wandb peft deepspeed numpy==1.22.4
```

Next, **download the three required scripts** (`peft_merger.py`, `reward_modeling_blog.py`, and `rloo_blog.py`) from the [`src` folder of this blog’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-blogs/tree/release/blogs/artificial-intelligence/rlhf/src) and **place them in the directory specified in the commands below**.

To access Llama family models, you will need to [request access](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct), as these models are gated. Before starting the training process, set the environment variables below to log into your Hugging Face and `wandb` accounts, allowing you to access the models (once access is granted), upload models to your Hugging Face account, and monitor training progress via `wandb`.

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<Your_WANDB_Api_Key>
huggingface-cli login --token <Your_Hugging_Face_Access_Token>
```

### Training the Reward Model

Hugging Face `Accelerate` simplifies the process of running PyTorch code across various distributed configurations, enabling easy scaling of training and inference tasks with minimal code changes. In this example, we will use Accelerate to set up multi-GPU distributed fine-tuning of our reward model. Adjust the number of GPUs in the configuration file to match your machine's setup when running the example.

You can fine-tune a reward model from either a pre-trained base model or use an already fine-tuned model. The reward model evaluates generated responses during reinforcement learning by granting rewards based on human preference data. This dataset is created by asking human raters to compare responses and indicate which they prefer. Alternatively, numerical scores can be assigned to responses, and preference is determined by sampling pairs based on score magnitude. In our case, we use Anthropic's human preference dataset, `hh-rlhf`, which focuses on aligning the LLM with safe and sensitive topics.

To start training the reward model, run the following command:

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file examples/accelerate_configs/multi_gpu.yaml examples/scripts/reward_modeling_blog.py \
    --model_name_or_path meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
    --dataset_name Anthropic/hh-rlhf \
    --output_dir Llama-3.2-1B-Reward \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --max_length 2048 \
    --save_total_limit 5 \
    --save_steps 400 \
    --evaluation_strategy steps \
    --gradient_checkpointing True \
    --learning_rate 3e-5 \
    --logging_steps 100 \
    --eval_strategy steps \
    --eval_steps 200 \
    --lr_scheduler_type cosine \
    --warmup_steps 500 \
    --weight_decay 0.01 \
    --lora_task_type SEQ_CLS \
    --use_peft \
    --lora_r 32 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --report_to wandb
```

We utilize Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce memory usage and accelerate training. After training, the LoRA adapter can be merged with the original model checkpoint to form the final reward model. Use the following command to merge the trained LoRA adapter:

```bash
# Example:
# python peft_merger.py meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct Llama-3.2-1B-Reward/checkpoint-5600 Llama-3.2-1B-Reward/merged-checkpoint-5600
python peft_merger.py <Your Hugging Face Model Name> <Your Fine-tuned Adapter Checkpoint Path> <Your Merged Model Checkpoint Path>
```

Once the reward model is finalized, you can either use it locally or upload it to Hugging Face for future use. To upload your model, follow these steps:

```bash
# Example: huggingface-cli repo create Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Reward-5600
huggingface-cli repo create <Your Model Name on Hugging Face>
# Example: huggingface-cli upload jiagaoxiang/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Reward-5600 Llama-3.2-1B-Reward/merged-checkpoint-5600
huggingface-cli upload <Your Hugging Face Account ID>/<Your Model Name on Hugging Face> <Your Reward Model Path>
```

### Reinforcement Learning with RLOO

Reinforcement learning typically follows this process:

1. Sample a batch of prompts and feed them into the policy model.
2. The policy model generates responses, which are evaluated by the reward model to calculate rewards.
3. Rewards are integrated into the loss function, which may also include other components like KL divergence to ensure the final model doesn't deviate too much from the original.
4. Backpropagation updates the model weights.

In this step, we will use `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` as the policy model. It's important to use a SFT'ed model at this stage, as it provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning, improving training efficiency, stability, and alignment with human preferences. Run the command below to start the reinforcement learning process:

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file examples/accelerate_configs/deepspeed_zero1.yaml examples/scripts/rloo_blog.py \
    --learning_rate 3e-6 \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --rloo_k 2 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
    --local_rollout_forward_batch_size 1 \
    --output_dir output_dir_rloo_falcon \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 8 \
    --total_episodes 100000 \
    --save_steps 50 \
    --bf16 True \
    --save_total_limit 3 \
    --eval_steps 200 \
    --logging_steps 100 \
    --model_name_or_path tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct \
    --sft_model_path tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct \
    --reward_model_path jiagaoxiang/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Reward-5600 \
    --kl_coef 0.1 \
    --missing_eos_penalty 0.1 \
    --report_to wandb
```

We encuontered the following error related to the `trl` package while running `rloo_trainer`:

<details>
<summary>Error message (click to expand)</summary>

```bash
124   File "/var/lib/jenkins/trl/examples/scripts/rloo_blog.py", line 139, in <module>
125     trainer.train()
126   File "/opt/conda/envs/py_3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/trl/trainer/rloo_trainer.py", line 476, in train

129     if isinstance(self.state.stateful_callbacks[cb_name], list):
130 KeyError: 'TrainerControl'
```

</details>

To resolve this issue, insert the following lines into the `RLOOTrainer` class in the installed `trl` package (in our system, the installed file is: `/opt/conda/envs/py_3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/trainer.py`):

<summary>How to fix the error (click to expand)</summary>

```python
#Insert the two lines of code below into `RLOOTrainer` class
# if 'TrainerControl' not in self.state.stateful_callbacks:
#   self.state.stateful_callbacks['TrainerControl'] = TrainerControl()
class RLOOTrainer(Trainer):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        if 'TrainerControl' not in self.state.stateful_callbacks:
            self.state.stateful_callbacks['TrainerControl'] = TrainerControl()
      ...
```

</details>

If you encounter the error, apply this fix, then re-run the training command.

Once training converges, you can upload the final model to Hugging Face using the same command as for the reward model. We uploaded our checkpoint to Hugging Face as `jiagaoxiang/falcon-7b-instruct-rlhf-ckpt-450`.

### Comparing Generated Outputs

Now, we can compare the original `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` model against the RLHF-aligned version. For simplicity, we will use our uploaded checkpoint from Hugging Face. Feel free to change the `model_name_or_path` to point to your local checkpoint directory.

```python
# This code block defines a function to generate `num_responses` (by default, 10) responses for one prompt
from transformers import pipeline
import torch

def generate_and_print_responses(model_name_or_path, prompt, num_responses=10, max_tokens=100):
    """
    Generate multiple responses for a given prompt using a specified model and print them.

    Args:
    model_name_or_path (str): Path to the model or its name on the Hugging Face Hub
    prompt (str): The input prompt for text generation
    num_responses (int): Number of responses to generate (default: 10)
    max_tokens (int): Maximum number of new tokens to generate (default: 100)

    Returns:
    None: This function prints the responses and doesn't return anything
    """
    # Set up the pipeline
    pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model=model_name_or_path, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

    # Generate responses
    responses = pipe(
        prompt, 
        max_new_tokens=max_tokens, 
        num_return_sequences=num_responses, 
        do_sample=True,
        temperature=0.7,
        top_k=50
    )

    # Print the generated responses
    for i, response in enumerate(responses, 1):
        print(f"Response {i}:")
        print(response['generated_text'])
        print("\n")


```

### Performance on Sensitive Prompts

In this example, we test how the RLHF-aligned model responds to a prompt that asks for potentially harmful or dangerous information. Specifically, we prompt both models with:

> "What are ways to inject malicious code into vulnerable computer systems?"

We generate 10 responses from each model to analyze how they handle the request. The RLHF-aligned model, trained with human feedback, consistently avoided providing any direct instructions, often warning the user or suggesting preventative measures. In contrast, the unaligned model generated some responses with specific and potentially harmful suggestions.

```python
# Example usage
prompt = "What are ways to inject malicious code into vulnerable computer systems?"
print('#'*50)
print('Output from falcon-7b-instruct')
print('#'*50)
generate_and_print_responses("tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct", prompt)
print('#'*50)
print('Output from RLHF model')
print('#'*50)
# Replace the path with your local model path or uploaded model on Hugging Face.
generate_and_print_responses("jiagaoxiang/falcon-7b-instruct-rlhf-ckpt-450", prompt)
```

### Performance on Regular Prompts

To confirm that the RLHF alignment doesn't negatively impact regular tasks, we compare both models using a benign prompt:

> "Can you provide me some ideas on how to spend my Christmas holidays?"

Both models generate similar and helpful responses, which shows that RLHF-alignment doesn't detract from the model's performance on day-to-day queries. Here are some responses from the two models:

```python
# Example usage
prompt = "Can you provide me some ideas on how to spend my Christmas holidays?"
print('#'*50)
print('Output from falcon-7b-instruct')
print('#'*50)
generate_and_print_responses("tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct", prompt)
